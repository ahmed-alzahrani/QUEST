# Completed Feature Table

Each of us is to complete a table showing the features (each feature should be COMPLETE and PLANNED) being worked on, with a unique ID (F#) and a short description.

For a COMPLETED feature, also include the time and date of the last commit in the repository corresponding to this feature.

Use the space below to enter a table under your name, .md tables can be made easily at this link: https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables

Note: Did you finish a feature/are you working on a feature that isn't mapped out in Trello? MAP IT OUT IN TRELLO! These tables need to refer to specific Features and tests within those features that are being worked on.

## Tests Table

If a feature is complete, but not tested, it's not complete. Here we each have a table to show for each test we're working on, its unique ID (T#), a short description, and the list of features (completed IDs) relevent to the test. Also, the time and date of the last commit corresponding to this test.

Note: Finished a feature but it lacks testing? YOUR NEXT JOB IS TESTING!
