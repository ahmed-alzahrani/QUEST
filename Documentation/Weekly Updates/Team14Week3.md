# Statement About Team Issues

This week our team had NO issues to report

# Completed Feature Table

Each of us is to complete a table showing the features (each feature should be COMPLETE and
PLANNED) being worked on, with a unique ID (F#) and a short description.

For a COMPLETED feature, also include the time and date of the last commit in the repository
corresponding to this feature.

Use the space below to enter a table under your name, .md tables can be made easily at this link:

Note: Did you finish a feature/are you working on a feature that isn't mapped out in Trello? MAP IT
OUT IN TRELLO! These tables need to refer to specific Features and tests within those features that
are being worked on.

## Tests Table

If a feature is complete, but not tested, it's not complete. Here we each have a table to show for
each test we're working on, its unique ID (T#), a short description, and the list of features
(completed IDs) relevent to the test. Also, the time and date of the last commit corresponding to
this test.

Note: Finished a feature but it lacks testing? YOUR NEXT JOB IS TESTING!

Again, tables can be formatted here: https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables

lAlthough some completed features have been tested informally (IE: T1 for #F1001). For example, I

```
can print out the created Adventure Deck on start of the game by clicking on the game object that
corresponds to the adventure deck. However, I have e-mailed JP re: The C# alternative he would
like us to use an alternative to JUnit.
```
Once I recieve an answer, hopefully for next week I can update this section with specific formal
testing for the features I'm currently working on as well as the features completed this week.

The updated ui still functions properly with the new changes the cards still hold up properly.
The preview card seems to work as well position and functionality wise but testing it on a some cards will be tested more generally soon.
