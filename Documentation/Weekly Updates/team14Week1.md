# Progress since last week (and hours worked)

***Ahmed Al-Zahrani (100900855):***
- Set up GH repo at https://github.com/ahmed-alzahrani/QUEST

- Set up Trello board at https://trello.com/b/C37Sfr8e

- Set up Discord server and relevant seperate channels for on demand group planning

- Re-read and solidified understanding of the game rules

- Created a first draft UML diagram to show a basic view of the different classes and their relations/compositions.

- Based on this UML diagram I began to create the actual .cs class files and pushed them as [WIP] to our repo, this will constitute my focus for next week

Hours worked: 12-14.

***Cheldon Mahon (101001843):***

- Completed C Sharp Tutorials - more in progress.

- Learned how use repostories.

- Set up a bitbucket repository.

- Solidified understanding of the game rules.

Hours Worked: 11

***Mohamed Kazma (101019719):***

- Implemented a very rough version of the game's main menu UI and the game's table board's UI. This includes a button for the hot seat game that switches the scene from main menu to the board scene.

- Setup board with lighting and a proper table texture to indicate to the player that they are playing on a table, as well as set up positions for the cards and decks and some basic ui graphical functionality (texturing a card, flipping animation, animation of highlighted etc.)

Hours Worked: ~10

***Julian Greppin (100899233):***

- Worked with Mohamed Kazma on UI design and development.

- Designed the title screen for UI

- Wrote an initial set of scenarios for iteration one with varying levels of abstraction to demonstrate how abstraction of scenarios changes over development

Hours Worked: ~10

# Goals for next week

***Ahmed Al-Zahrani (100900855):***

- My goal for next week will revolve around fleshing out those .cs class files, Ideally I will be able to collaborate with M. Kazma and set up the initial game condition with the gameboard view, including having all of the initial decks/hands for a hot seat game properly set up with the corresponding objects.

- Additionally, I want to improve my UML diagram, currently my member functions are not totally inclusive to the functionality that will need to be included once we've fleshed out the functionality of the game, additionally I noticed after pushing my UML diagram a few simple errors (wrong return types for getters etc).

***Cheldon Mahon (101001843):***

- My goal will be to start relating the C Sharp tutorials towards the game logic (scripts).

***Mohamed Kazma (101019719):***

- Finish off the complete functionality of the main menu scene in the UI

- Began linking some of the scripting functionality with the game board's UI graphics (pending collaboration with Ahmed A. on that)


***Julian Greppin (100899233):***

- Finish incorporating new assets into the UI, including those for the main menu / title screen as well as the gameboard scene

- Setting up the initial card positions (hands, decks, etc.) for the beginning of the game
