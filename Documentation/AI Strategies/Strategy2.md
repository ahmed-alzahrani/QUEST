# Should I participate in this Tournament?
This CPU will always participate in every single Tournament.

# What should I play in a Tournament?
This CPU plays as few cards as possible to get to 50BP, or best possible hand if 50 isn't possible.

# Should I sponsor this Quest?
This CPU will NOT sponsor the quest if another player can evolve by winning it.

Else, the  CPU will sponsor the quest if the CPU has enough valid cards to set up the quest. The CPU defines this as having one foe per stage (one less required if a test card is in the CPU's hand) as well as having foes with differing BPs that allow the CPU to keep in line with the rule of increasing BPs.

# How do I setup a Quest?

Final Foe Stage: This CPU sets up the final stage to be a foe encounter with at least 50BP, by playing as few cards as possible to hit 40BP, or plays its strongest possible hand if 40BP isn't possible.

Second Last Stage: This CPU will set up the second last stage to be a test stage if possible.

Earlier Foe Encounters: All other foe encounters, for stages 1 -> x-1 or 1 -> x-2 where x is the number of stages in the quest and depending on whether or not a test stage was possible. This CPU sets up the previous stages in the order they will be played, by using their weakest foe in each stage and no weapons.

# Should I participate in this Quest?

This CPU will participate in this Quest if the following two conditions are met, if either of them are not met, this CPU will NOT participate in this Quest.

Condition1: This CPU has the requisite valid cards to increment the BP it plays by 10 in each stage.

Condition2: This CPU has at least 2 foes with less than 25BP (to discard for a test).

# How do I play a final foe stage?
This CPU plays the strongest valid combination in their hand.

# How do I play a test stage?
This CPU will bid twice, round1 and round2.

Round1: This CPU will bid the number of foes in their hand with 25 or less BP (but won't bid duplicate foes), starting with their weakest foes. If their bid isn't greater than the current bid in the test, they bid 0 and drop out.

Round2: This CPU will bid identically to how they did in round1, but will also include duplicate foes if possible.

# How do I play an earlier foe stage?
This CPU increments the BP of their play by +10 from the last round, using amour first, then allies, then weapon(s).
