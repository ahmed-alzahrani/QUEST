# Should I participate in this Tournament?
This CPU will participate in a Tournament if any player (including this CPU) can evolve by winning this Tournament.

# What should I play in a Tournament?
First, this CPU checks if anyone participating in the Tournament can evolve by winning this tournament, if they can, it's considered a high stakes tournament, otherwise it is low stakes.

High Stakes Tournament: This CPU will play their strongest possible hand (including amour and allies)

Low Stakes Tournament: This CPU will play any weapons of which they have 2 or more instances of in their hand.

# Should I sponsor this Quest?
This CPU will NOT sponsor the quest if another player can evolve by winning it.

Else, the  CPU will sponsor the quest if the CPU has enough valid cards to set up the quest. The CPU defines this as having one foe per stage (one less required if a test card is in the CPU's hand) as well as having foes with differing BPs that allow the CPU to keep in line with the rule of increasing BPs.

# How do I setup a Quest?

Final Foe Stage: This CPU sets up the final stage to be a foe encounter with at least 50BP, by playing as few cards as possible to hit 50BP, or plays its strongest possible hand if 50BP isn't possible.

Second Last Stage: This CPU will set up the second last stage to be a test stage if possible.

Earlier Foe Encounters: All other foe encounters, for stages 1 -> x-1 or 1 -> x-2 where x is the number of stages in the quest and depending on whether or not a test stage was possible. This CPU sets up the previous stages in a backward order to be the strongest foe in their hand along with any weapons of which this CPU has two or more instances of while respecting the valid order of battle points.

# Should I participate in this Quest?

This CPU will participate in this Quest if the following two conditions are met, if either of them are not met, this CPU will NOT participate in this Quest.

Condition1: This CPU has 2 weapons/allies per stage in the Quest.

Condition2: This CPU has at least 2 foes with less than 20BP (to discard for a test).

# How do I play a final foe stage?
This CPU plays the strongest valid combination in their hand.

# How do I play a test stage?
This CPU will only bid once, and will bid the number of foes in their hand with 20 or less, starting with their weakest foes. If their bid isn't greater than the current bid in the test, they bid 0 and drop out.

# How do I play an earlier foe stage?
This CPU tries to play Amours and Allies, if they can play 2, they can. If there aren't 2 Allies/Amours in the CPU's hand to fill out their play, they start trying to fill out their 2 card play with their weapons in order from weakest to strongest.
