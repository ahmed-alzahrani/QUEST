Scenario 2:

- Chivalrous Deed is drawn (everyone +2 shields)

- Pox is drawn (everyone but P2 loses 1 shield)

- Tournament at Camelot is drawn by CPU1

      CPU1 joins because he can tell someone is eligible to level up from this tournament
      CPU2 joins because CPU2 always joins tournaments
      P1 Joins to play nothing
      P2 Does NOT JOIN (human decision)

- Because P2 (the one who could rank up) is NOT in the quest, CPU1 ONLY plays duplicate weapons whereas CPU2 plays his quickest hand to 50 BP.
  CPU2 wins and ranks up with the shields just gained.

- Next, CPU2 draws Plague and loses 2 shields.

- P1 then draws Queen's Favor and, along with CPU1, gain an additional 2 adventure cards

- P2 Draws King's Call next and discards 1 weapon as the leader

- CPU1 then draw's King's Recognition, providing bonus shields to the next winner of a Quest

- CPU2 draws the Test of the Green Knight Quest (4 stages):
            CPU2 declines to sponsor because someone can rank up
            P1 Sponsors as follows (human):
                    1. Thieves + Dagger
                    2. Mordred
                    3. Test of Morgan Le Fey
                    4. Green Knight + Lance

- P2 Enters the Quest
- CPU1 joins because he has the correct # of foes to discard and cards to play
- CPU2 declines because he does not have two weak foes to dicard in case of a test

CPU1 Plays:
    1. Amour + Pellinore
    2. Gawain
    3. Bid of 4 on the first round, 0 on the second round


P2 Plays (Human):
    1. Lance
    2. Excalibur
    3. A bid of 3 on the first round, then 5
    4. Ax, Lance, excalibur

P2 wins and receives the bonus shields from King's Recognition


- Lastly, P1 draws Court Called --> This should flush active allies (Pellinore) from all players (CPU1)
