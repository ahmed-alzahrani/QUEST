Scenario 3:

This scenario, played with 4 human players will demonstrate the following:
        - Tournament can be handled
        - Pox can be handled
        - Plague can be handled
        - Queen's Favor can be handled
        - Percival/Gawain can be handled
        - King's Call To Arms can be handled
        - Mordred can be used
        - Court Called to Camelot
        - A test is supported



1. Chivalrous Deed is drawn (everyone +2 shields)

2. Pox is drawn (everyone but P2 loses 1 shield)

3. Tournament at Camelot is drawn by P3
This tournament can be resolved however you'd like with the available tournament cards in the players hands

4. Plague is drawn and P4 loses 2 shields

5. P1 draws Queen's Favor and the lowest ranking player(s) draw

6. P2 draws King's Call and the leader(s) discard

7. P3 draws King's Call, the next winner of a quest receives the bonus

8. P4 draws Test of the Green Knight
      - It is best to let P1 sponsor, he has the Green Knight foe ;)
      - This quest can resolve properly as our game logic only allows you to sponsor the quest if you have requisite cards
      - Make sure to have P3 play King Pellinore during this quest, to prove the effect of Court Called to Camelot after the quest

9. Court Called is played and flushes King Pellinore out of P3's active allies




CPU Version:

What this proves:
      - CPU1 and CPU2 handling of a tournament
      - CPU1 and CPU2 Handling of a Quest, specifically with a test stage


1. Chivalrous Deed is drawn (everyone +2 shields)

2. Pox is drawn (everyone but P2 loses 1 shield)

3. Tournament at Camelot is drawn by CPU1
        - CPU1 joins because someone is eligible to rank up
        - CPU2 joins because CPU2 always joins tournaments
        - P1 joins
        - P2 does not join


Because P2 (the one who could rank up) is NOT in the quest, CPU1 ONLY plays duplicate weapons whereas CPU2 plays his quickest hand to 50 BP.
CPU2 wins and ranks up with the shields just gained.

4. CPU2 draws Plague and loses 2 shields.

5. P1 then draws Queen's Favor and, along with CPU1, gain an additional 2 adventure cards

6. P2 Draws King's Call next and discards 1 weapon as the leader

7. CPU1 then draw's King's Recognition, providing bonus shields to the next winner of a Quest

8. CPU2 draws the Test of the Green Knight Quest (4 stages):
            CPU2 declines to sponsor because someone can rank up
            P1 Sponsors as follows (human):
                    1. Thieves + Dagger
                    2. Mordred
                    3. Test of Morgan Le Fey
                    4. Green Knight + Lance

- P2 Enters the Quest
- CPU1 joins because he has the correct # of foes to discard and cards to play
- CPU2 declines because he does not have two weak foes to discard in case of a test

CPU1 Plays:
    1. Amour + Pellinore
    2. Gawain
    3. Bid of 4 on the first round, 0 on the second round


P2 Plays (Human):
    1. Lance
    2. Excalibur
    3. A bid of 3 on the first round, then 5
    4. Ax, Lance, excalibur

P2 wins and receives the bonus shields from King's Recognition


- Lastly, P1 draws Court Called --> This should flush active allies (Pellinore) from all players (CPU1)
