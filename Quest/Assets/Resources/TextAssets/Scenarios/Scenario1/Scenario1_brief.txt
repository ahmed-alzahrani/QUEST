Scenario 1:

This scenario, played with four human players, will demonstrate the following:

        - A quest can be sponsored by the player who drew the Quest Card
        - P1 who drew the card can accept/decline the quest
        - P1 is able to select cards for BOTH stages
        - The quest is correctly set up with two foes
        - The rule of increasing BPs is enforced
        - The rule of no repeated weapons is enforced
        - The UI helps enforce these rules
        - Players 2, 3, and 4 are asked whether or not they want to participate
        - Each participant in the Quest is offered an Adventure Card
        - The rule of 12 cards max is enforced, a player is given the chance to PLAY in the stage before being asked to discard
        - Hotseat works to allow P2,P3,P4 to see their OWN cards
        - A player can play 0 cards to contest a foe stage
        - The resolution of a foe stage is correctly done
        - The cards played are correctly discarded
        - Player 2 (who played nothing) is correctly eliminated
        - Do p3, p4 get another adventure card and properly discard
        - Once p3, p4 have played, do we get the correct winner and do they get the right # of shields
        - Are p1s cards from setting the Quest discarded?
        - Does P1 get the correct # of cards back after sponsoring?
        - Can the second story card (Prosperity Throughout The Realm) be drawn by P2?
        - Does Prosperity properly give everyone cards / handle discarding for hands with more than 12
        - Does p3 draw the event card Chivalrous deed?
        - Does it give everybody 3 shields?


Instructions:

1. Boar Hunt is played, P1 decides to sponsor the quest as follows:

Stage 1 --> Saxons (10)
Stage 2 --> Boar + Sword + Dagger (30)
P2 --> Participate
P3 --> Participate
P4 --> Participate

Round 1:
P2 Should play: Nothing (0)
P3 Should play: Horse (10)
P4 Should play: Battle-Ax (15)

P2 will be knocked out, P3 and 4 will continue


Round 2:
P3 Should play --> Lance (20)
P4 Should play --> Excalibur (30)

P3 will be knocked out and P4 will both win and be appropriately awarded shields.

2. Prosperity Throughout The Realm is played, every player is given two adventure cards and prompted to discard.

3. Chivalrous Deed is played, all players except P4 will receive 3 shields.



CPU Version:

What this proves:

      - CPU1 and CPU2 strategies for playing foe encounters in the quest
      - CPU1 and CPU2 strategies for taking part in a quest
      - CPU1 and CPU2 strategies discard cards properly

The only difference is that P3 will be CPUStrategy1 and P4 will be CPUStrategy2.

P1 still sponsors the quest, P2 still joins and plays nothing in the first round.

CPU1 will play an Amour and an Ally as per Strategy 1
CPU2 will play just an Amour to increment by 10 ASAP.
P2 should still play nothing.

CPU 1 and 2 will both play their strongest hands as per their strategies and win round 2 so they will both win, the rest of the scenario plays out exactly like the human version.
