Game Setup:
Separate cards into rank adventure and story decks. 
Shuffle the story deck and place it in the center of the table.
Place a squire card face up in front of each player to indicate he begins with a rank of squire. The remaining rank cards are placed aside for use later in the game.
Each player places his ten identical shields next to his squire card.
Shuffle and cut the adventure deck. Deal 12 Adventure cards to each player.

Game Sequence:
The player left to the dealer starts first and plays always occurs in clockwise direction.
At the beginning of every turn the player turns over the top card of the story Deck to see what will occur during his turn.
•	Quest Card: announce a quest and follow the rules in quests
•	Tournament Card: a tournament is announced, and the players follow the rules of tournaments
•	Event Card: an event is announced and the player whose turn it is must follow the rules described.
A player cannot have more than 12 cards, if he does, he should either player an excess card or discard one.

Battle Points:
You will battle other players in tournaments and foes in quests how well you do depend on your strength, which is measured in battle points. The more battle points you have the stronger you are.
Battle points are indicated by the number in the bottom center of the rank, foe, weapon, ally, amour cards.
Squires have 5 battle points, knights have 10, champion knights have 20.
However, you can increase your strength during a quest or tournament, by using weapon, ally, and amour cards. You add those values to your rank.
The foes you fight during quests also have battle points which are indicated on their cards, they can only increase their battle points using weapon cards.

Shields and Rank:
Each time you win a tournament or a quest, you receive a certain number of shields. The number of shields you win is determined by the event card you play.
They are placed on your rank card and are used as counters for progressing in rank.
The number shields needed to advance in rank is:
Squire -> knight:  5shields
Knight->Champion Knight: 7shields
Champion Knight-> Knight of the Round table: 10 shields

If you more than is necessary, the shields still add up on the new rank card.

Sponsoring a Quest:
The player who drew the quest card can sponsor the quest. Sponsors of a quest will receive new cards at the end of the quest (draws from adventure deck the number of cards he used to sponsor the quest + the number of stages of the quest). The sponsor sets up the stages of the quest using only foe and weapon cards or a test card alone to represent a stage of the quest. The sponsor does not compete in the quest, he oversees it making sure the rules are followed. If he refuses to sponsor the quest (doesn’t have enough cards or simply doesn’t want to), then the next player to his left can decide whether he wants to and so on. If all the players decline to sponsor the quest, then the quest card is discarded and the turn ends.
Setting Up a Quest:
The Quest card is placed on the table. It states how many stages are in the quest. Each stage is an obstacle that all players that join the quest have to overcome to complete the quest. For each stage, the sponsor places a foe card (and maybe some weapon cards) or a test card face down in groupings beside the quest card. The number of stages is equal to the number of stages on the quest card. (ONLY ONE FOE OR TEST CARD CAN BE ADDED EACH STAGE). If we place a foe we can place as many weapon cards to supplement it as we want but they cannot be the same as any of the already added ones. In addition, the total battle points of foe + weapon cards must be increasing in every stage of the quest. Some foes have 2 battle point values, if the foe has the same name as that in the quest, then we use the higher one else use the lower one. Test cards do not have battle points and can be played at any stage of the quest (battle points of previous quests don’t matter). ONLY ONE TEST CARD CAN BE PLACED PER QUEST.

Playing a Quest:
After the stages are setup by the sponsor, players will decide whether to join the game or not. Players that do not join, sit out the quest until it ends. At the beginning of each stage, a card from the adventure deck is handed out to all the players in the quest. The sponsor announces whether each stage has a foe or test card.
If it is a foe, each player must fight the foe. Before discovering what type of foe he is facing, he must decide how much strength he wishes to use to overcome the foe’s battle points. Each player will decide which card to use to defeat the foe based on the number of battle points needed to defeat him.
He places those cards face down on the table. Player’s minimum strength the battle points of his rank card. We can add to that strength using weapon, amour, ally cards. A player can play more than one weapon card per stage. As long as he does not play the same TYPE of weapon card. A player may not play more than one amour card per quest, and when the quest is over, it is discarded. 
A player can play any number of ally cards at any time?????(that’s weird to implement???). The battle points provided by ally cards are added to those of rank for the duration of the game unless an event card or the Mordred card is used. After all the players place their cards for stage, the sponsor turns over the cards for the stage, If the battle points of the player’s cards are greater than or equal to that of the foe’s with the weapon cards he proceeds to the next stage. (players that proceed draw a card mentioned above). The ones defeated sit out the rest of the quest. Weapon cards are discarded at the end of the stage amour at the end of the quest and ally cards never.

If it is a test card, a bidding contest ensues, players bid cards and who bids the most cards wins. The sponsor immediately turns the Test card face up. The players must now bid starting from the left on the sponsor. A BID IS THE NUMBER OF CARDS A PLAYER IS WILLING TO DISCARD IN ORDER TO CONTINUE ON THE QUEST ALONE. Each player bid must be higher than the last or he drops out of the quest. This continues until everyone has either bid or dropped out and continues until no one will bid higher.
All amour and ally cards provide free bids if they are placed on the table. It reduces the number of cards to be discarded. 
The winner will draw a card and continue to the next quest. If there is one player with a test card, he bids the minimum number indicated by the card if there is no minimum, then make a minimum of 3 cards. If he can’t he drops out and the quest is over.

Mordred foe card:
It is used either as a regular foe card or to remove another player’s ally from play. You just choose which one to remove and both Mordred and ally card are placed in the discard pile of the adventure deck. It can be placed at any time during a quest or a tournament.
Ending a quest:
if all players are defeated or drop out the quest is ended. 
One or more player makes it through all of the stages of the quest.
All successful players receive as many shields as there are stages in the quest. The sponsor draws from the adventure deck (mentioned above). 
The quest card is discarded in the adventure deck discard pile.
All adventure and story cards other than the ally cards are discarded at the end of the quest.
When the decks are used up, reshuffle them and continue play.
Tournaments:
Each player decides whether to enter the tournament or not (using clockwise sequence from the drawing player). If only one player enters he is automatically awarded a shield for entering + any bonus shields indicated on the tournament card.
(What if none join????)
Each entering player draws one card from the adventure deck.
Each player must decide which cards from his hand he will use to challenge other players with. They can play weapon, amour, and ally cards to increase the battle points of his rank (mot more than one amour card and no 2 of the same TYPE of weapon card). Ally cards on the table do not add up to your battle points.
Simultaneously, all players show their cards and the player with the most battle points of rank, ally, and cards he used wins the tournament. 
The winner gets a number of shields equal to the number of players of the tournament (some tournament cards give extra winner bonus shields).
Tie-breaking in tournaments:
The players in a tie discard the weapon cards ally and amour remain. Each player will decide which cards to play and the second round is the same as the first.If there is also a tie, all the tieing players receive as many shields as the number of players in the original round.
Winning the game:
As soon as a player gets enough shields to become a knight of the round table, he declares himself the winner during the same turn. If more than one gets there, then a final tournament occurs with these players. The winners of the last tournament wins if they tie both win.

Two-Player Games:
Same rules except only one player in quests and there is no competitive bidding in tests so player bids minimum or three (mentioned above).
